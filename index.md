## Course Description
The Database Systems field has been exploring issues in data 
storage, management, processing and analysis for over 50 years. In our data-rich 21st century, the lessons of the field apply increasingly broadly across Computer Science and beyond.

In this course we will study a range of papers from the distant and recent
past. Given the breadth of the field, it is not possible to cover it comprehensively. Our focus
will largely be on core database systems topics, and while the emphasis will
be on systems work we will not shy away from theoretical results where relevant. The readings 
will mix classic papers with emerging results, and revisit topics that may be ripe for revival given current technology trends.

## Course Format
**This is a graduate seminar, and student participation is a key part of the experience.
The course will be held in-person, and regular attendance is mandatory.**

The bulk of the course will involve learning from research papers, both classics and 
recent results. Students will be expected to read papers in advance of class, and participate in class discussion. Students will also undertake independent research as part of the course.

<!-- The course will have two phases. For the first few weeks, we will read papers
from some of the foundational systems in the field. Classes will be in lecture
format for this phase, with class discussion.

The second phase will emphasize more recent work. The format for this 
phase is TBA, but will likely include required participation from students. -->
